AVLTreeMap Test:
AVLTreeMap Initial Content
(1,A)(2,B)(3,C)(4,D)(5,E)(6,F)(7,G)(8,H)(9,I)(10,J)
Delete KEY=3 Result:
(1,A)(2,B)(4,D)(5,E)(6,F)(7,G)(8,H)(9,I)(10,J)
The result after modifying the value of KEY=5 to M5:
(1,A)(2,B)(4,D)(5,M5)(6,F)(7,G)(8,H)(9,I)(10,J)
Get Value with KEY=9:I
The result after adding KEY=100 VALUE=HELLO:
(1,A)(2,B)(4,D)(5,M5)(6,F)(7,G)(8,H)(9,I)(10,J)(100,HELLO)
The number of elements in AVLTreeMap = 10
Is AVLTreeMap empty = false



HashMap Test:
HashMap Initial content
(1,A)(2,B)(3,C)(4,D)(5,E)(6,F)(7,G)(8,H)(9,I)(10,J)
Delete KEY=3 Result:
(1,A)(2,B)(4,D)(5,E)(6,F)(7,G)(8,H)(9,I)(10,J)
The result after modifying the value of KEY=5 to M5:
(1,A)(2,B)(4,D)(5,M5)(6,F)(7,G)(8,H)(9,I)(10,J)
Get Value with KEY=9:I
The result after adding KEY=100 VALUE=HELLO:
(1,A)(2,B)(4,D)(5,M5)(6,F)(7,G)(8,H)(9,I)(10,J)(100,HELLO)
